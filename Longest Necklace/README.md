You have a lot of beads. Each bead has a number from 0 to N-1. You want to build a necklace. An array A is given containing for bead i the next bead in the necklace. For example

```
A[0] = 5
A[1] = 4
A[2] = 0
A[3] = 3
A[4] = 1
A[5] = 6
A[6] = 2
``` 

In this case the function should return 4, because the longest necklase is the one containing four beads: numbers {0,5,6,2}
