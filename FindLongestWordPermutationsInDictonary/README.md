Given a string of letters and a dictonary, the function longestWord should find the longest word or words in the dictionary that can be made from the letters.

Input: letters = "oet", dictionary = {"to", "toe", "toes"}

Output: {"toe"}

Only lowercase letters will occur in the dictionary and the letters

The length of letters will be between 1 and 10 characters.

The solution should work well for a dictionary of over 100.000 words

If time permits, introduce '?' which can represent any letter. "to?" could match to "toe", "ton", etc.
